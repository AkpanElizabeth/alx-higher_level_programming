Import statements in Python are used to load external modules or packages into a program, which allow the program to use additional functionality beyond what is built into the Python language. The import statement searches for the named module in a set of directories specified in the Python path.

A module is simply a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the .py extension. A module can contain functions, classes, variables and other definitions that can be used in a Python program by importing the module.
